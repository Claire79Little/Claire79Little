## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a UX/UI designer passionate about crafting beautiful, intuitive digital experiences that prioritize users at every step. This space is a collection of my design explorations, prototypes, and collaborative work focused on bridging the gap between design and development.

My design process is centered on understanding user needs, solving real-world problems, and creating interfaces that are both visually compelling and highly functional. I work with tools like Figma, Sketch, and InVision to bring ideas to lifeâ€”from wireframes and low-fidelity mockups to interactive prototypes and polished UI components.

Figma is my primary design tool for its collaborative capabilities and flexibility. I use it to structure design systems, build reusable components, and maintain consistency across entire product experiences. Sketch and InVision also play important roles in refining visuals and gathering user feedback through interactive flows.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find shared assets, design documentation, and sometimes front-end code snippets that align with my design work. While GitHub is typically a developerâ€™s space, I believe itâ€™s a great platform for sharing design systems, collaborating with engineers, and showcasing the thinking behind visual decisions.

Iâ€™m especially interested in the intersection of design and developmentâ€”ensuring that the user experience is carried through seamlessly from mockup to production. Whether it's refining usability, improving accessibility, or just making a screen feel more delightful, I enjoy sweating the details that elevate digital products.

Feel free to explore the projects, offer feedback, or connect if you're working on similar goals. Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate with developers, designers, and product teams who care deeply about building great user experiences.
